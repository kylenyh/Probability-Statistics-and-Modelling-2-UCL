1a. The correlation plot generally shows weak associations between crime rate and the variables examined. The proportion of adults with no educational qualifications in an area (pnoquals) has a correlation coefficient of -0.11, suggesting a weak negative relationship indicating that as educational attainment increases, crime rates slightly decrease, though this effect is minimal. On the other hand, the proportion of adults with a first language other than English (pengfl) has a positive correlation of 0.23, indicating a weak but positive relationship, where areas with more non-native English speakers tend to experience higher crime rates. The highest correlation is between the proportion of adults born outside of the UK (pnukb) and crime rate, with a coefficient of 0.24, but this is still a weak positive relationship. The relationship suggests only slight increases in crime rate as the number of individuals born outside of the UK increases. Overall, none of these variables strongly impact crime individually, as all correlations remain weak.


1b. The percentages noted by the intern (0.6% to 5.8%) likely refer to the proportion of variance in the crime rate that is explained by each explanatory variable in the model. This means that each variable contributes only a small percentage to explaining the changes in crime rates, with some variables accounting for as little as 0.6% and others up to 5.8%. These results suggest that while some explanatory variables have a slightly larger effect on crime rates, none of them alone explain a significant portion of the variance. This also implies that there are likely other unmeasured factors that influence crime rates more substantially and the variables included in the model offer only a limited explanation for the variations in crime across different areas.


1c. Looking at the correlation value of 0.007, this almost suggests that there is no statistical relationship between population density and crime rate, as the value is nearing zero. Based on this observation, this can be supported by the conclusion that there is no statistical relationship between the 2 variables due to the p value being higher than the standard significance level of 5%. This would make sense logically because although an increase in population could potentially lead to a large increase in crime rate, crime prevention strategies such as the police, urban planning, security technologies and social services can effectively mitigate the level of crime. 


1d. Choosing to exclude the explanatory variable regarding the proportion of adults not born in the UK (pnukb) may have been a good choice. The reason for this may be because looking at the correlation matrix provided earlier on, the variable did not have a significant correlation with crime rate from a statistical association perspective. Therefore, including it in the model might have added unnecessary complexity without contributing meaningful explanatory power.


1e. Referring to the results of model 1, the coefficient value for pbname is -1.32931, which statistically implies that for each unit increase in the proportion of adults from ethnic minorities in the area, the crime rate is expected to decrease by -1.32931, holding the other variables constant. The surprise of the findings with regards to the assigned coefficient value for pbname could have arisen from the pre-assumptions that an area with a higher ethnic population could have led to a higher level of crime rate. However, logically thinking about this, appropriate crime prevention strategies, such as improved law enforcement agencies, policing, improved socio-economic conditions and effective communication may have contributed to lowering the level of crime rates in different areas, aligning with the conclusion of the statistical relationship between the 2 variables. Hence, I would not share the intern’s surprise, as the relationship between ethnicity and crime is complex and other factors such as poverty, inequality and community engagement can also play more significant roles in affecting the level of crime rates than ethnicity alone.


1f. When comparing Table 1 to Model 1, the direction of relationships between the crime rate and the explanatory variables remains consistent, however, the magnitude of the coefficients changes slightly. For pbame, the coefficient is negative in both models, indicating a consistent inverse relationship with the crime rate. However, the coefficient becomes slightly more negative over time, from approximately -1.3 in Model 1 to -1.4 in Table 1, suggesting that the relationship weakens over the four years. This could imply that, as time progresses, the effect of the proportion of adults from ethnic minorities on the crime rate becomes slightly stronger. The t-values for pbame also differ, with a stronger negative t-value in Model 1 (-24.88) compared to Table 1 (-13.8), indicating that the relationship was more statistically significant in model 1. Similar trends are shown for other variables, such as pengfl and pnoquals, which show consistent directions but some differences in the strength of the coefficients over time. This suggests that while the point estimates remain stable, the impact of these variables may fluctuate slightly, perhaps due to changes in external factors or data variability over time.






2a. The graph provided in the image is an example of a residual density plot. In linear regression, residuals should ideally follow a normal distribution with a mean of zero. If the residuals are normally distributed, their density plot would resemble a symmetric bell curve centered around zero. 
From the plot, it can be seen that the residuals are heavily skewed to the left, with a long tail extending towards positive values. This indicates a deviation from normality, as a large proportion of residuals cluster near zero, but there are also significant outliers in the positive range.
The presence of residuals far from zero, particularly in the high positive range (near 1000 and beyond), suggests that there may be outliers or high-leverage points in the data. This could indicate that the model has trouble fitting certain observations or that some extreme values are impacting the model fit. In a well-fitted linear regression model, residuals should average out to zero. While this graph doesn’t directly provide information about the mean of residuals, the heavy skew suggests that there might be a slight bias. If the mean of residuals is not close to zero, this could indicate that the model systematically underestimates or overestimates the target variable.


2b. The figure indicates a residuals vs. fitted values plot, where the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) are plotted on the y-axis, while the fitted values (predicted values from the model) are plotted on the x-axis. In a linear regression model, for homoscedasticity to hold the random scatter of points should be scattered around the line, which would show that the assumption of linearity holds. However, in this plot, the residuals appear to be unevenly distributed, with some clustering around zero but also several large residuals far from zero, especially at higher fitted values. This suggests potential issues with the model fit, such as outliers or heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance), where residuals tend to increase as fitted values increase. Therefore, the presence of large residuals and the uneven scatter in the plot implies that the assumptions of linear regression may not hold fully. Specifically, the assumption of homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals) might be violated, as the spread of residuals increases with fitted values.


2c. The four plots in the figure above showcase residual plots that showcase the relationships between between Pearson residuals and various predictor variables (pbame, pengfl, pnoquals) as well as fitted values from a regression model. Each of the plots shows patterns or outliers that might violate the model's assumptions or reveal influential observations. The four plots each examine residuals against a different variable or metric (individual predictor variables and fitted values) to provide a clear presentation of model fit. In each graph, most residuals are clustered near zero, suggesting the model fits most observations reasonably well. However, a few points stand out as large residuals, indicating possible outliers or influential observations that may not fit the model well. Specifically, in the plots against predictors and fitted values, there seems to be a lack of clear pattern, which is ideal, as patterns might suggest non-linearity or other model misspecifications. The presence of outliers, however, suggests that these points should be investigated further, as they could disproportionately impact model accuracy.


2d. From an epistemological standpoint, quantitative methods and statistics are powerful tools for understanding measurable phenomena, but they do not encompass the entirety of human knowledge or understanding. Knowledge is not solely derived from empirical data; it also emerges from qualitative insights, intuition, and subjective experience, which statistics cannot quantify. For example, areas such as ethics, consciousness, and aesthetic judgment often require interpretative approaches to gain meaningful insights, as they involve subjective or context-dependent nuances that numbers alone cannot capture. Additionally, qualitative research methods, like ethnography or phenomenology, provide in-depth insights into human experiences and social phenomena, offering perspectives that quantitative data might overlook. By relying exclusively on quantitative methods, one risks oversimplifying complex realities and missing aspects that only qualitative, context-sensitive approaches can reveal. 


2e. The question of whether "God plays dice with the universe" touches on debates around determinism and randomness in nature. This phrase, attributed to Einstein, reflects his discomfort with the inherent randomness in quantum mechanics, as he believed the universe operates predictably. Quantum mechanics, however, suggests that at a fundamental level, some events are probabilistic rather than deterministic, challenging the classical view of a fully ordered universe. In a broader, perhaps theological sense, this question could imply whether the universe is governed by absolute laws or if there is room for randomness, chance, or divine intervention. Philosophically, one could argue that both randomness and order coexist, allowing for a universe that is both structured and unpredictable.








3a. Using 90% confidence intervals (CIs) rather than the more conventional 95% is a strategic decision that comes with both advantages and drawbacks. A 90% CI is narrower, which increases statistical power, making it easier to detect associations that might not reach significance at a stricter threshold. This is particularly useful in exploratory or preliminary research, where the goal is to identify potentially important trends that warrant further investigation.
However, reducing the confidence level also increases the risk of a Type I error—incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. In other words, there's a 10% chance (rather than 5%) that the observed effect is due to random variation rather than a true association. 


3b. Model 3.1 and Model 3.2 both explore the association between victimisation and knowing how to contact the police, but they differ in the variables included and the method used. In Model 3.1, the only explanatory variable is victimisation, while Model 3.2 includes victimisation and several control variables, such as sex, disability, ethnicity and student status. 
In Model 3.1, which is on the log‑odds scale, the intercept of –0.5687 (95% CI [–0.6008, –0.5368]) represents the baseline log‑odds of knowing how to contact the police for someone who has not been a victim of crime. Because this interval does not include zero, we conclude that non‑victims have a significantly negative log‑odds—and thus a probability well below 0.5—of knowing how to contact the police. The victimisation coefficient of 0.4356 (95% CI [0.3408, 0.5302]) indicates that having been a victim increases the log‑odds of awareness by 0.4356. Exponentiating this coefficient gives an odds ratio of 1.55, meaning victims are 55% more likely than non‑victims to know how to contact the police. The confidence interval excludes zero, confirming that this positive effect is statistically significant.
In Model 3.2, coefficients are presented directly as odds ratios. The intercept OR of 0.5662 (95% CI [0.5484, 0.5846]) shows that, after adjusting for demographic controls, non‑victims have odds of awareness that are 44% lower than 1 (the reference).  Because the interval does not include 1, this difference is significant. The victimisation OR of 1.55 (95% CI [1.41, 1.70]) confirms that, even when controlling for sex, disability,  ethnicity and student status, victims remain 55% more likely to know how to contact the police compared to non‑victims. The CI excludes 1, demonstrating that this adjusted effect is also statistically significant and that including controls yields a more precise estimate (slightly narrower CI) of victimisation’s impact.


3c. The findings from Model 3.3, which examine factors influencing awareness of how to contact the police, have significant policy implications. Specifically, the statistical significance of variables like victimisation, sex, disability and ethnicity suggests that demographic factors play an important role in shaping citizens' awareness. Policy efforts aimed at increasing public awareness of how to contact the police should prioritize vulnerable groups, particularly victims of crime, who have a higher likelihood of knowing how to contact the police. Moreover, targeting certain demographics like individuals with physical disabilities or those from ethnic minorities might further enhance the effectiveness of public awareness campaigns. 


3d. If victimisation were made the outcome variable and knowing how to contact the police became the explanatory variable, the interpretation of the relationship between the two would change significantly. The Beta coefficient for knowing how to contact the police would likely become negative (assuming people who know how to contact the police are less likely to be victims), which would suggest that knowledge of contact methods reduces the likelihood of being a victim. This change would reflect a reverse causal assumption—that people who are aware of how to contact the police are less vulnerable to crime, as opposed to the current model where victimisation predicts awareness.
The Hosmer-Lemeshow test, which assesses the model's goodness of fit, would likely perform worse because the outcome variable would be less directly related to the explanatory variable than in the current model. In this case, knowing how to contact the police is likely a less direct predictor of victimisation than the reverse relationship. As a result, the comparative fit indices (AIC, BIC), which assess model parsimony and fit, would likely increase for the reverse model, indicating poorer fit compared to the original model. This suggests that Model 3.2 (with victimisation as the outcome) provides a more meaningful and plausible fit compared to switching the outcome and explanatory variables.


3e. Based on Model 3.3, the populations that should be the focus of a public awareness campaign on how to contact the police would likely be those who are least likely to know how to contact the police. According to the model’s findings, variables like victimisation, disability status, and ethnicity may significantly influence awareness of police contact methods. Victims of crime are more likely to know how to contact the police, so the campaign should focus on non-victims, who may have less awareness of these procedures. Additionally, groups like individuals with physical disabilities and ethnic minorities (especially those from groups with lower awareness) should be targeted. People from certain ethnic groups and those with low education or income levels may have lower awareness due to factors such as language barriers, previous experiences with law enforcement, or mistrust in the police. Thus, the campaign should prioritize these under-informed groups to improve accessibility and engagement with the police, ensuring that everyone knows how to contact them when needed.



3f. The intern’s claim that the missing data is missing completely at random (MCAR) suggests that the missing cases are unrelated to both the observed and unobserved data. Evidence to support this claim could include:
•	No significant relationship between missingness and other variables in the dataset (i.e., the missing values are randomly distributed across the population).
•	Little's MCAR test, which is commonly used to assess if data is missing completely at random, could have been performed to validate this claim. If the test fails to reject the null hypothesis, it would support the assumption of MCAR.
However, based on the large increase in missing cases for Model 3.3, the intern may be overestimating the degree of randomness. The missing cases could be due to systematic biases, such as people who did not respond to certain survey questions or were not able to complete them due to certain demographic characteristics (e.g., age, education, or internet access). If these missing values are related to observed or unobserved factors, then the missing data would likely be not missing completely at random (MNAR) or missing at random (MAR), which would require more advanced techniques (e.g., imputation) to handle appropriately. Therefore, the intern may not be entirely right, as assuming MCAR without proper testing could lead to biased results in the final analysis.
