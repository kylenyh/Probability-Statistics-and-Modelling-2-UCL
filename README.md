# Probability-Statistics-and-Modelling-2-UCL

This module equips students with the knowledge needed to understand and critically evaluate crime and security research, as well as the skills required to analyse and learn from data. Building on the PSM I module, students get to know the generalised linear model with various link functions, including linear, binary logistic, multinomial logistic, ordinal logistic, and count models. You can only learn statistics by doing statistics. This means that this course will focus on statistical inference, intuition, and interpretation. It will also teach students how to use the statistical programme R for statistical modelling. This module consists of main lectures, supplementary lectures, and tutorials. The main lectures cover statistical concepts and show what they mean and how to apply them to research questions. The tutorials help you put these concepts into practice using the statistical software R. Finally, the supplementary lectures provide deep dives into topics that are pertinent to applied data analysis (such as how to analyse surveys or missing data) and ethical research practices (such as “p-hacking” and pre-registration).
